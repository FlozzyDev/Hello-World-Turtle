# Overview

This project is "Hello World", a python application that greats the user when it is run and displays some fun animations using the python turtle library.

When the application is run, a small turtle greets the user and then does laps around the screen while "Hello World" is played on the screen.

I wanted to create a simple software that demonstrates some basic functionality of the turtle library while still making a simple "Hello World" application.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code
Python 3.13.3
    - Lib/turtle.py
Git/Github

I decided to use Python for this application as I have some experience with it and I enjoy it's clean syntax. The turtle library has solid documentation and it was very easy to pick up and begin to experiment with different animations. The documentation for it is listed below. 

# Useful Websites

Here are some sites that I found useful when building this project. Turtle has fairly basic syntax and these websites make it clear. There is also a variety of youtube videos that demonstrate different examples of how to utilize it.
